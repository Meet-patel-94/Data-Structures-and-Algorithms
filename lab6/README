Summarize your lab:

For my code all the programs work for part1, part2 and part3.
     

Answer the following questions in your README file.

Question 1. Which hash table collision resolution method did you use (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice briefly (less than 25 words).

    Answer: I used linear probing because it allows one word per table space in order to do a count.
 

Question 2. Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use? How did you convert a string into a number?

ANSWER: I used the division method. I used the ASCII values of the characters to convet the strings to a number.

 
 
Question 3. Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the "stand-alone" tag. This kind of tag combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one. It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the final >. (For example, the <foo/> is a stand-alone tag that is "self balancing".

Describe briefly how you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.

 
       
ANSWER: I will modify part 3 in such a way that when the alphabets are scanned, it should stop at > or /. If it is stopped at >, program should do nomal tasks for start tags. If its is stopped at /, program should do normal tasks for start tags and end tags together.
